This project demonstrated how I set up a highly available, scalable, and secure environment using AWS services such as VPC, EC2, Auto Scaling, and Application Load Balancer. By implementing this architecture, the application became resilient to failures, scaled according to demand, and ensured secure access to AWS resources. This setup was ideal for production environments that required high availability and security.
